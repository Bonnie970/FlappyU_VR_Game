## Inspiration
Have you ever been **addicted** to the super duper popular game **Flappy Bird**? We all have been! We have also been always fascinated by the development process of VR games. 


## What it does
This hacking pushes Flappy Bird to another level with HTC Vive! 

In this game, you, *the bird* face obstacles, which you need to pass from between them, by flying **with your own arms**!!! 

During the game, the stunning view of our landscapes passes by, and **nothing stops you from moving forward !!!**

## How I built it
This VR game was developed using Unity and SteamVR SDK for HTC Vive.  

## Challenges I ran into
No one in our team had game development experience, but we installed Unity and learned SteamVR SDK from online resources to bring Flappy Bird to life! 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are very proud of our game, which we developed within a short amount of time. We managed to learn and integrate a **brand new** technology with our passion! Also, we couldnâ€™t be more proud of our teamwork, which was the key for successfully developing our game. Everyone in our team made equal contributions and were dedicated to accomplishing the project tasks. 


## What I learned
We learned about how to use Unity for VR games alongside 3D modelling including landscape design, as well as sound streaming. We also built upon our teamwork skills and we had a lot of fun at McHacks! 


## What's next for FlappyU
We are planning to publish FlappyU on Steam!
