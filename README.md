# McHacks2018-FlappyU
VR version of Flappy Bird with actual flappy moving

## Inspiration
Have you ever been **addictive** to the super duper popular game **Flappy Bird**? We all are! 

We are also curious about VR game developing after playing so many VR games! 

## What it does
This hacking pushes Flappy Bird to another level with HTC Vive! 

**You, the bird**, facing obstacles, flying for real **with your arms**! 

The stunning view of landscapes passes by, **nothing stops you from moving forward !!!** 

## How I built it
This VR game was developed using Unity and SteamVR SDK for HTC Vive.  

## Challenges I ran into
No one in our team has game developing experience, but we installed Unity and learned SteamVR SDK on site to make this game happen! 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are very proud the game is well developed in such a short time and we were able to learn and integrate a **brandly new** technology with our passion and braveness!
We are also proud of our teamwork. Everyone in our team distributed a lot and made commitment to their tasks. 

## What I learned
We learned how to use Unity environment for VR games 3D model building, landscape design, and sound strimming. We also developed teamwork skills and had so much fun in McHacks! 


## What's next for FlappyU
We are planning to publish FlappyU on Steam VR game website!
